# Learning C++
> The purpose of this repository is for me to log my progress and my journey as I learn C++. I 
> will be using the textbook *Programming Principles and Practice Using C++* by Bjarne 
> Stroustrup to learn C++ from scratch and to continue sharpening my understanding about 
> programming. 

## Previously Learned Languages:
> This is in order of most recent.
>
> Language | Experience
> -------- | ----------
> **C** | Intermediate
> **Assembly** | Beginner
> **Python** | Intermediate
> **Java** | Intermediate

## Organization
> This repository will be organized by the **four** parts of the textbook:
>
> Parts | Name
> ----- | ----
> **Part I** | **"The Basics"**
> **Part II** | **"Input and Output"**
> **Part III** |  **"Data and Algorithms"**
> **Part IV** | **"Broadening the View"**
>
> Each directory in this repository will be named by the part's **name**. At the bottom of 
> this **README**, there will be a list of the **directories** and each of their **files**. 

## Building Programs:
> Each **part directory** will have a **makefile** that you can use to make a certain program.
>
> `$ make <name of the program, no .cpp>`

## Cleaning:
> This will remove all binary and object files from the repositories
>
> `$ make clean`
